#Overview 
This React web app is designed to create a responsive web page. It uses React with bootstrap, as well as read-more-react and react-responsive libraries to allow users to view the page on any device. The page is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to tailor the page to their own needs. 

#Setup
To set up the React web app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Additionally, the following packages must be installed in order to use the app:

• React: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react
• React-bootstrap: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap
• Read-more-react: https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-more-react

Once these packages are installed, you can begin building the web page. 

#Components
The React web app consists of several components: 

• Container: The container is the main structure of the page, and is used to contain the other components.
• Navbar: The navbar allows users to navigate the page, and can be customized with various options.
